| keywords that I will have learn more | Questions from the article |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|whole exome sequencing  | What insights can whole exome sequencing provide about genetic variations that might affect how patients respond to clopidogrel and other medications? |
|Drug Mechanism | How do clopidogrel and aspirin work together to prevent blood clots after heart procedures? |
|Genetic Impact | How do genetic differences, like variations in the CYP2C19 gene, affect how well clopidogrel works in different people? |
|PON1 Gene | What is the role of the PON1 gene in clopidogrel's effectiveness, and why might this vary between people? |
|Ethnic Differences | How do genetic differences between ethnic groups affect the effectiveness of clopidogrel? |
|Study Goals about PON1 and CYP2C19 | What is the goal of studying the impact of PON1 and CYP2C19 genes on clopidogrel in the Thai population? |
|Study Population | What were the criteria for selecting the 211 patients in the study on clopidogrel resistance, and what conditions led to their exclusion? |
|Platelet Aggregation Testing | How was platelet aggregation measured in the study, and what tools and methods were used for this process? |
|Genotyping Methods | What techniques were used to identify genetic variants in the CYP2C19 and PON1 genes among the study participants? |
|Genetic Interactions | How did the study assess the interaction between PON1 and CYP2C19 gene variants in relation to clopidogrel resistance?|
|Responder Classification | How were the CAD patients categorized into responders and non-responders to clopidogrel in the study? |
|Baseline Comparisons | Were there any significant differences in age, BMI, sex, or underlying diseases between clopidogrel responders and non-responders? |
|Acute Coronary Syndromes | What is the role of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin in the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and prevention of ischemic events? |
|Clopidogrel Bioactivation | How does the enzymatic biotransformation of clopidogrel into its active thiol metabolite involve the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme, and what is the significance of this process in platelet inhibition? |
|Aspirin Mechanism | What is the mechanism by which aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits platelet aggregation, and how does this complement the action of clopidogrel in dual antiplatelet therapy?|
|Genetic Polymorphisms | How do common genetic variants within the CYP2C19 gene, specifically CYP2C192 and CYP2C193, impact the effectiveness of clopidogrel therapy in preventing adverse cardiac events? |
